ROV Subside
===========

This repository contains all of a topside control system for our ROV, as well as a graphical user interface. 
The control system handles joystick inputs and data communication, while the GUI presents camera feed and sensor 
data to the pilots.

This repository contains all of the software that runs on Njord (ROV V1.0).

The system is split into four nodes
- CCU (Central Control Unit)
- MCU (Manipulator Control Unit)
- TCU (Thruster Control Unit)
- PCU (Positioning Control Unit)
